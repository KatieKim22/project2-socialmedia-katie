## Credits
Although this project was a group project, Katie Kim is the MVP for this project. She had put in a lot of work and dedication to have this application running. I only manage the models, some handlebars, and seeds folder. Most of the work was done by Katie Kim as I have to give credits to her for her hard work. 

P.S. To Katie, I know that I was not a very good group member for this project. I had multiple things going on during that time period and I know that I might be making up excuses. I apologize for not able to help you more in this project. I hope things are going to be better for you. You are very smart and I am really glad I had you for a group member. Thank you for all you do. I will you be best of luck in the future! 

best, 
Minh Nguyen
